  abstract = {Ensuring that inferences from biological monitoring are reliable requires a level of sampling effort that is commensurate with programmatic objectives and reflects attributes of target populations. Consensus guidelines have emerged to guide allocation of sampling effort for programmes designed to detect trends in occupancy but not for abundance, despite its prevalence as a target parameter. We evaluated the influence of population attributes (density, availability, detection probability and magnitude of trend) and sampling design features (number of sites, number of repeat surveys, and survey-year interval) on a Bayesian analogue of statistical power to detect declines in abundance estimated using distance sampling methods. For a range of values common to terrestrial vertebrates, we simulated spatially and temporally replicated populations from which we generated survey data. We then analysed each dataset with a hierarchical open-population model that allowed for temporary emigration to estimate power for periods of 5--20 years. For a given amount of sampling effort, power to detect trends was highest when effort was allocated to maximizing the number of sites by decreasing the number of repeat surveys within a year and increasing the interval between survey years. For example, to have an 80\% chance of detecting a 3\% annual decline required 40\% longer when 67 sites were surveyed three times per year compared to 600 sites surveyed once every three years despite both allocations requiring 4,000 surveys over 20 years. Notably, these patterns were independent of density or detectability of the target species, which contrasts with occupancy studies where optimal allocation shifts from surveying more sites to more repeat surveys when detectability is low or occupancy is high. Synthesis and applications. Our findings provide guidance for allocating resources efficiently for distance sampling studies focused on terrestrial vertebrates. By comparing the approximate density and detectability of target populations to those we considered, monitoring programmes can balance the amount of survey effort allocated to sites, surveys per site, and annual revisits to help ensure sufficient power to meet objectives effectively and efficiently. These decisions are increasingly important as budgets for conservation decrease and consequences of inaction continue to increase.},

  abstract = {Estimating spatiotemporal patterns of population density is a primary objective of wildlife monitoring programs. However, estimating density is challenging for species that are elusive and/or occur in habitats with limited visibility. In such situations, indirect measures (e.g., nests, dung) can serve as proxies for counts of individuals. Scientists have developed approaches to estimate population density using these ``indirect count'' data, although current methods do not adequately account for variation in sign production and spatial patterns of animal density. In this study, we describe a modified hierarchical distance sampling model that maximizes the information content of indirect count data using Bayesian inference. We apply our model to assess the status of chimpanzee and elephant populations using counts of nests and dung, respectively, which were collected along transects in 2007 and 2021 in western Uganda. Compared with conventional methods, our modeling framework produced more precise estimates of covariate effects on expected animal density by accounting for both long-term and recent variations in animal abundance and enabled the estimation of the number of days that animal signs remained visible. We estimated a 0.98 probability that chimpanzee density in the region had declined by at least 10\% and a 0.99 probability that elephant density had increased by 50\% from 2007 to 2021. We recommend applying our modified hierarchical distance sampling model in the analysis of indirect count data to account for spatial variation in animal density, assess population change between survey periods, estimate the decay rate of animal signs, and obtain more precise density estimates than achievable with traditional methods.},

This paper provides an in-depth analysis on the impact of REDD+ on forest-dependent communities. The dimensions which are included in this review are institutions and governance, livelihoods, socio-cultural aspects, and the environment. Many studies confirm that forest-dependent communities are not sufficiently involved in current REDD+ projects. Furthermore, current and potential impacts of REDD+ on communities often disrupt local peoples' livelihoods and strategies, institutions and socio-cultural systems in various ways, such as unequal benefit sharing, food insecurity, introduction of new powerful stakeholders, illegal land acquisition, unfair free prior and informed consent, and the introduction of monoculture plantations. REDD+ is also perceived as a neoliberal mechanism which renegotiates peoples' relationship with the natural environment by monetizing nature. The paper concludes with a framework which addresses the potential drivers and threats of REDD+ concerning forest-dependent communities based on the literature review. This framework suggests a holistic approach to REDD+ implementation, which incorporates forest-dependent communities' often complex relationship with the natural environment, such as incorporation of traditional forest management systems and provision of viable alternatives to loss of agricultural land.},

  abstract = {Southeast Asian countries, which encompass four global biodiversity hotspots, currently experience some of the highest rates of tropical deforestation in the world due to the expansion of oil palm and rubber plantations, logging, and urbanisation. Moreover, land-use change in Southeast Asia has been forecast to continue to expand alongside growing global demand for food, biofuels, and other natural-resource commodities, with potentially dire consequences for the region's diverse biota through habitat loss. Recent studies have forecast 21st century biodiversity loss in the Southeast Asian region using global projections of land-use change. However, these projections are too coarse to provide accurate predictions of biodiversity change at regional and biogeographic (i.e., biodiversity hotspot or national) scales, which are more relevant for effective policy planning and conservation interventions. Here we applied the reverse species-area-relationship (SAR) to regionally specified land-use scenarios, to predict the proportion of Southeast Asia's species (locally) committed to extinction by the year 2100. We project biodiversity outcomes ranging from best-case scenarios of stability or potential recovery of species through to a worst-case of additional losses (of up to 1.60~\% of species lost). Whether species are lost or recovered depends on levels of future socio-economic development. In contrast to earlier work, we highlight that if sustainable development is pursued, not all is `doom and gloom' for the region's diverse biota.},

To inform future conservation measures for this poorly known species, we used ecological niche factor analysis, habitat suitability modelling and distance sampling to determine landscape-scale habitat requirements and estimate the population size. Using GIS software, we integrated digital layers of ecogeographic variables with; (1) presence-only observations to derive and validate a habitat suitability model using ecological niche factor analysis, and (2) distance sampling to determine population distribution and densities across vegetation types. We detected populations in only five of seven reserves which they had occupied in 2000. We estimate the global population size to be 16,821 individuals (range 8431--39, 104), 68\% greater than the previously estimated 10,000 individuals, with a single large reserve containing the majority ({$\sim$}92\%) of the global population. The Mallee Emu-wren is a habitat specialist, primarily occurring in mallee-Triodia vegetation that has not been burnt for at least 15 years. The highest densities were in vegetation associations containing at least a 15\% cover of Triodia, however, time since the habitat was last burnt was the overriding factor in determining densities. Large-scale wildfires are a pervasive threat to the global status of the Mallee Emu-wren, and the risk to remaining populations is exacerbated by the adverse impact of prolonged drought and the potential for altered fire regimes caused by global warming. Evaluation of the global population status, and the continued wildfire threat warranted recent reclassification of the Mallee Emu-wren from Vulnerable to Endangered according to IUCN Red List categories and criteria.},

We present a hierarchical model allowing inference about the density of unmarked populations subject to temporary emigration and imperfect detection. The model can be fit to data collected using a variety of standard survey methods such as repeated point counts in which removal sampling, double-observer sampling, or distance sampling is used during each count. Simulation studies demonstrated that parameter estimators are unbiased when temporary emigration is either ``completely random'' or is determined by the size and location of home ranges relative to survey points. We also applied the model to repeated removal sampling data collected on Chestnut-sided Warblers (Dendroica pensylvancia) in the White Mountain National Forest, USA. The density estimate from our model, 1.09 birds/ha, was similar to an estimate of 1.11 birds/ha produced by an intensive spot-mapping effort. Our model is also applicable when processes other than temporary emigration affect the probability of being available for detection, such as in studies using cue counts. Functions to implement the model have been added to the R package unmarked.},

Most seeds in the Oriental Region, except near its  northern margins, are dispersed by vertebrate families which are endemic to the  region or to the Old World. Small fruits and large, soft fruits with many small  seeds are consumed by a wide range of potential seed dispersal agents, including  species which thrive in small forest fragments and degraded landscapes. Larger,  bigger-seeded fruits are consumed by progressively fewer dispersers, and the  largest depend on a few species of mammals and birds which are highly vulnerable  to hunting, fragmentation and habitat loss.},

This paper updates a review of frugivory and seed dispersal by vertebrates in the Oriental Region (tropical and subtropical Asia) published in 1998. The major conclusions remain the same. Small fruits are consumed by a wide range of potential seed dispersal agents, including species that thrive in small forest fragments and degraded landscapes. Larger and larger-seeded fruits are consumed by progressively fewer dispersers, and the largest depend on a few species of mammals and birds which are highly vulnerable to hunting, fragmentation, and habitat loss. Controlling hunting in both forest areas and the agricultural matrix must be a top priority for conservation. A lot more natural history information has been added to the literature since 1998. This reinforces previous evidence for the importance of hornbills, bulbuls, elephants, gibbons, civets, and fruit bats in seed dispersal, and suggests that the roles of green pigeons, macaques, rodents, bears, and deer were previously underestimated. The taxa for which additional natural history observations would be most valuable include fish, pheasants, pigeons, babblers, rodents, and even-toed ungulates. For other animal taxa, future frugivory and seed dispersal studies need to focus more on the fitness consequences for both the plants and the animals.},

We showed that multi-species monitoring frameworks can be used to understand how species abundance changes across space and time, providing indications as to how they are responding to environmental dynamics or management prescriptions---both of which are valuable tools for under-resourced wildlife conservancies.},

We identify Borneo and Indochina, in particular, as major ``evolutionary hotspots'' for a diverse range of fauna and flora. Although most of the region's biodiversity is a result of both the accumulation of immigrants and in situ diversification, within-area diversification and subsequent emigration have been the predominant signals characterizing Indochina and Borneo's biota since at least the early Miocene. In contrast, colonization events are comparatively rare from younger volcanically active emergent islands such as Java, which show increased levels of immigration events. Few dispersal events were observed across the major biogeographic barrier of Wallace's Line. Accelerated efforts to conserve Borneo's flora and fauna in particular, currently housing the highest levels of SE Asian plant and mammal species richness, are critically required.},

  abstract = {Increasing emphasis on social and environmental safeguards for REDD+ in the UNFCCC and work under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) have prompted growing interest in biodiversity monitoring for REDD+, but most discussions of REDD+ monitoring have so far centred on greenhouse gas emissions and removals at national level. Challenges in monitoring biodiversity for REDD+ include choosing which aspects of biodiversity to monitor, the difficulty of attributing particular changes to REDD+ and the likely scarcity of resources for biodiversity monitoring. Three responses can help address these challenges. First, already-agreed policy targets can help to identify what should be monitored. Second, making links to existing biodiversity monitoring and to monitoring to estimate GHG emissions and removals (both remote sensing and ground based inventories) can provide some solutions. Finally, developing clear theories of change can assist in determining which changes in biodiversity can be attributed to REDD+.},

  abstract = {Numerous modelling techniques exist to estimate abundance of plant and animal populations. The most accurate methods account for multiple complexities found in ecological data, such as observational biases, spatial autocorrelation, and species correlations. There is, however, a lack of user-friendly and computationally efficient software to implement the various models, particularly for large data sets. We developed the spAbundance R package for fitting spatially explicit Bayesian single-species and multi-species hierarchical distance sampling models, N-mixture models, and generalized linear mixed models. The models within the package can account for spatial autocorrelation using Nearest Neighbour Gaussian Processes and accommodate species correlations in multi-species models using a latent factor approach, which enables model fitting for data sets with large numbers of sites and/or species. We provide three vignettes and three case studies that highlight spAbundance functionality. We used spatially explicit multi-species distance sampling models to estimate density of 16 bird species in Florida, USA, an N-mixture model to estimate black-throated blue warbler (Setophaga caerulescens) abundance in New Hampshire, USA, and a spatial linear mixed model to estimate forest above-ground biomass across the continental USA. spAbundance provides a user-friendly, formula-based interface to fit a variety of univariate and multivariate spatially explicit abundance models. The package serves as a useful tool for ecologists and conservation practitioners to generate improved inference and predictions on the spatial drivers of abundance in populations and communities.},

A Bayesian approach to a basic line-transect analysis is developed for a half-normal detection function. We extend the model of Karunamuni and Quinn [Karunamuni, R.J., Quinn II, T.J., 1995. Bayesian estimation of animal abundance for line-transect sampling. Biometrics 51, 1325--1337] by including a binomial likelihood function for the number of objects detected. The method computes a joint posterior distribution on the effective strip width and the density of objects in the sampled area. Analytical and computational methods for binned and unbinned perpendicular distance data are provided. Existing information about effective strip width and density can be brought into the analysis via prior distributions. The Bayesian approach is compared to a standard line-transect analysis using both real and simulated data. Results of the Bayesian and non-Bayesian analyses are similar when there are no prior data on effective strip width or density, but the Bayesian approach performs better when such data are available from previous or related studies. Practical methods for including prior data on effective strip width and density are suggested. A numerical example shows how the Bayesian approach can provide valid estimates when the sample size is too small for the standard approach to work reliably. The proposed Bayesian approach can form the basis for developing more advanced analyses.},

SMART (Spatial Monitoring And Reporting Tool) software has been developed to aid in fluidly displaying, managing, and reporting on ranger patrol data. These data can be analysed using spatial modelling to inform decision-making. Here we use Favourability Function modelling to generate risk maps from the data gathered on threats (fire, poaching and deforestation) and the presence of Western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) in the Dja Forest Reserve (DFR), southern Cameroon. We show that the more favourable areas for the three study species are found within the core of the DFR, particularly for elephant. Favourable areas for fires and deforestation are mostly along the periphery of the reserve, but highly favourable areas for poaching are concentrated in the middle of the reserve, tracking the favourable areas for wildlife. Models such as the ones we use here can provide valuable insights to managers to highlight vulnerable areas within protected areas and guide actions on the ground.},

  abstract = {Abstract Estimating the density and distribution of invasive populations is critical for management and control efforts but can be a challenge in nascent infestations when population densities are low. Statistically-valid sampling designs that account for imperfect detection of individuals are needed to estimate densities across time and space. Survey methods that yield reliable estimates allow managers to determine how invader biomass affects ecosystem services and evaluate population trends and effectiveness of control measures. We investigated the use of distance sampling via self-contained underwater breathing apparatus divers to determine densities of invasive Zebra Mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in 2 recently-invaded lakes in central Minnesota. This framework allows divers to cover the large areas necessary in low-density, recent infestations. We estimated that a diver could detect between 5 and 41\% of the mussels present in the surveyed area, depending on the specific diver and on whether the lake bottom was vegetated. Presence of vegetation had a greater influence on detection probability than diver identity. We also found our sampling design did not meet a key assumption of conventional distance sampling: that detection along the transect line is perfect. Therefore, accurate density estimates required a double-observer approach. These results highlight the importance of accounting for detectability when comparing estimates over time or across lakes, particularly when different observers conduct surveys. However, further evaluation is needed to determine if changes in field sampling techniques can meet the assumptions behind conventional distance sampling for freshwater mussels. We also suggest that the efficiency of distance sampling should be compared to alternatives such as quadrat sampling across a range of mussel densities.},

Here we review a range of methods available to estimate national-level forest carbon stocks in developing countries. While there are no practical methods to directly measure all forest carbon stocks across a country, both ground-based and remote-sensing measurements of forest attributes can be converted into estimates of national carbon stocks using allometric relationships. Here we synthesize, map and update prominent forest biomass carbon databases to create the first complete set of national-level forest carbon stock estimates. These forest carbon estimates expand on the default values recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidelines and provide a range of globally consistent estimates.},

  abstract = {Proposed offshore wind energy development on the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf has brought attention to the need for baseline studies of the distribution and abundance of marine birds. We compiled line transect data from 15 shipboard surveys (June 2012--April 2014), along with associated remotely sensed habitat data, in the lower Mid-Atlantic Bight off the coast of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, USA. We implemented a recently developed hierarchical community distance sampling model to estimate the seasonal abundance of 40 observed marine bird species. Treating each season separately, we included six oceanographic parameters to estimate seabird abundance: three static (distance to shore, slope, sediment grain size) and three dynamic covariates (sea surface temperature [SST], salinity, primary productivity). We expected that avian bottom-feeders would respond primarily to static covariates that characterize seafloor variability, and that surface-feeders would respond more to dynamic covariates that quantify surface productivity. We compared the variation in species-specific and community-level responses to these habitat features, including for rare species, and we predicted species abundance across the study area. While several protected species used the study area in summer during their breeding season, estimated abundance and observed diversity were highest for nonbreeding species in winter. Distance to shore was the most common significant predictor of abundance, and thus useful in estimating the potential exposure of marine birds to offshore development. In many cases, our expectations based on feeding ecology were confirmed, such as in the first winter season, when bottom-feeders associated significantly with the three static covariates (distance to shore, slope, and sediment grain size), and surface-feeders associated significantly with two dynamic covariates (SST, primary productivity). However, other cases revealed significant relationships between static covariates and surface-feeders (e.g., distance to shore) and between dynamic covariates and bottom-feeders (e.g., primary productivity during that same winter). More generally, we found wide interannual, seasonal, and interspecies variation in habitat relationships with abundance. These results show the importance of quantifying detection and determining the ecological drivers of a community's distribution and abundance, within and among species, for evaluating the potential exposure of marine birds to offshore development.},

  abstract = {Building useful models of species distributions requires attention to several important issues, one being imperfect detection of species. Data sets of species detections are likely to suffer from false absence records. Depending on the type of survey, false positive records can also be a problem. Disregarding these observation errors may lead to important biases in model estimation as well as overconfidence about precision. The severity of the problem depends on the intensity of these errors and how they correlate with environmental characteristics (e.g. where species detectability strongly depends on habitat features). A powerful modelling framework that accounts for imperfect detection in the modelling of species distributions has developed in the last 10--15 yr. Fundamental to this framework is that data must be collected in a way that is informative about the observation process. For instance, such data can be in the form of multiple detection/non-detection records obtained from several visits/observers/detection methods at (at least) some of the sites, or from data on times to detection within a survey visit. The framework can extend to studying species' range dynamics and the modelling of communities, as well as approaches for analysing data on abundance and multiple occupancy states (rather than binary presence/absence). This paper summarizes these modelling advances, discusses evidence about effects of imperfect detection and the difficulties of working with it, and concludes with the current outlook for future research and application of these methods.},

Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms.

For many rare butterflies, these estimates do not exist, and conservation decisions rely instead on expert opinion. Using Bartram's scrub-hairstreak (Strymon acis bartrami, US Endangered) as a case study, we present a novel comparison of two methods that permit the incorporation of detection probabilities into abundance estimates, distance sampling and double-observer surveys. Additionally we provide a framework for establishing a systematic sampling scheme for monitoring very rare butterflies. We surveyed butterflies monthly in 2013, increasing intensity to weekly when butterflies were detected. We conducted 19 complete, island-wide surveys on Big Pine Key in the Florida Keys, detecting a total of 59 Bartram's scrub-hairstreaks across all surveys. Peak daily abundances were similar as estimated with distance sampling, 156 butterflies (95~\% CI 65--247), and double-observer, 169 butterflies (95~\% CI 65--269). Selecting a method for estimating abundance of rare species involves evaluating trade-offs between methods. Distance sampling requires at least 40 detections, but only one observer, while double-observer requires only 10 detections, but two observers. Double-observer abundance estimates agreed with distance sampling estimates, which suggests that double-observer is a reasonable alternative method to use for estimating detection probability and abundance for rare species that cannot be surveyed with other, more commonly used methods.},

Conservation planning is essential to ensure that hotspots of biodiversity and endemism have the protection needed to prevent deforestation, hunting and other forms of exploitation in some of the Southeast Asia's most diverse areas, yet this requires data which in many cases does not exist. Growing volumes of online available data provides the ability to develop accurate models of species distributions, and gain new perspectives on regional diversity patterns and provide essential baseline data for planning and conservation. Here, using the best available information I develop maps of the ranges of 2471 vertebrate (birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians) and 1198 plant species, and explore patterns of biodiversity and the adequacy of protection. Each taxon shows different patterns of diversity, and no taxa provided an effective surrogate for diversity patterns in different groups. I show that for the majority of biodiversity hotspots fall outside protected areas, with between 10 and 55\% of areas with at least {$>$}75\% of the maximum number of species unprotected. The percentage of species ranges protected areas also varies by taxa, from a maximum of 40\% to reptiles with a mean of only 13.5\% of species ranges protected. Furthermore comparison between my predictions and IUCN maps of diversity differed greatly for all taxa examined, with IUCN hotspots covering a much larger portion of the region and potentially overestimating the ranges of many species. Further efforts are needed to better protect centres of diversity, and the inclusion of these methods into regional conservation planning may greatly assist in increasing the effectiveness of conservation.},

Lack of data on wild population genetic diversity and connectivity hinder conservation efforts to restore evolutionary potential to populations of such species. We applied noninvasive sampling, population genetics and phylogeographic analyses to assess genetic diversity and connectivity among three Great Hornbill wild populations across three regions of Thailand (Eastern, Western and Southern) using partial mitogenome sequences (14,118\,bp) from 52 wild individuals and 97 captive individuals. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity of the Southern population was highest, compared to Eastern and Western populations. Despite higher levels of poaching and fragmentation, maintenance of mitogenome diversity in the Southern population could be due to genetic exchanges with Malaysian populations, or historically large effective populations occupying Sundaic habitats. Relatively low to moderate genetic differentiation observed among the three Thai populations suggested limited fragmentation effects on historical population connectivity. This finding aligns with the absence of population-specific clades seen in our phylogenetic analyses. The Southern population had the highest number of private haplotypes and there was significant genetic structure between Southern and Western and between Southern and Eastern populations perhaps suggesting the presence of southern glacial refugia and subsequent secondary contact following population expansion and recolonization of habitats during interglacial periods in the Late Pleistocene. These findings may provide insights for developing effective strategies for Great Hornbill reintroduction, and for monitoring the impacts of human disturbance on population genetic connectivity and species persistence in fragmented landscapes.},

  abstract = {This paper empirically quantifies environmentally augmented rural household incomes in Cambodia and analyzes how economic land concessions (ELCs) affect such incomes. Data is derived from a structured survey of 600 randomly selected households in 15 villages in three study sites in Cambodia, where local livelihoods are highly reliant on access to land and natural resources, supported by qualitative data from focus group discussions. Gini coefficient decomposition, multiple regression models, and propensity score matching (PSM) models were employed to analyze the composition of income portfolios, determinants of major income sources, and the impacts of land grabbing on incomes. Results documented high reliance on environmental income (32--35\% of total household income) and farm income (51--53\%) across income quartiles; demonstrated the variation in product composition across quartiles and the contribution of each major product to income inequality; and identified the main household characteristics influencing absolute and relative incomes. ELCs were found to consistently have negative impacts on household total income, environmental income, size of available cultivable land and livestock holdings, and increasing the distance to forests. The total household annual income subjects to ELCs were estimated to decrease by 15--19\%. While providing some employment opportunities, we find no evidence of positive income effects of ELCs on households in the areas where ELCs are located.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity monitoring and data-management technologies can enhance the protection of persecuted species, such as African elephants (Loxodonta africana), through providing management-relevant information. Implementing these technologies, however, often presents several capacity and resource challenges for field staff in protected areas. In the Mid-Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZPWMA) is in the process of adopting the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) as law enforcement and data management tool for adaptive management. With the support of several conservation partners, ZPWMA was able to acquire SMART equipment (computers and handheld cyber-tracker devices) as well as train rangers and officers on how to use SMART in the region. Following the training and provision of SMART equipment, most protected areas (6 out of 7) in the Mid-Zambezi Valley have adopted SMART for law enforcement and relevant data are being collected. This study draws from the first-hand experience of training workshops, interviews with field staff, observations from support visits, and discussions with conservation partners in the Zambezi Valley. We observed that the introduction of SMART was marred by (a) technical and capacity challenges, (b) behavioral and human dynamics challenges, and (c) resources challenges. These were linked to ineptness among patrol rangers and officers, discomfort with the new technology, and uneven distribution of resources to implement SMART. To help overcome some of the challenges, we propose the development of an integrated SMART implementation plan, motivation of field staff, learning from implementation models of institutions that have successfully implemented SMART, and the provision of more SMART equipment.},

Here we focus on recent advances in unmarked functionality to support multi-species, multi-state, and multi-season data, as well as support for fitting models with random effects. For illustration, we present an analysis of Acadian Flycatcher Empidonax virescens abundance on Roanoke River National Wildlife Refuge, North Carolina, USA, over 18 years. We found that Acadian Flycatcher abundance was initially greater in hardwood plantation habitat relative to bottomland hardwood forest along river levees but that abundance declined over time in both habitats. We plan for unmarked development to keep pace with advances in hierarchical modelling in ecology, including better handling of continuous-time data from camera trap and automated recording units and integrated models for multiple data streams.},

  abstract = {Large frugivores are considered to be important seed dispersers for many tropical plant species. Their roles as seed dispersers are not well known in Southeast Asia, where degraded landscapes typically lack these animals. Interactions between 259 (65 families) vertebrate-dispersed fruits and frugivorous animals (including 7 species of bulbul, 1 species of pigeon, 4 species of hornbill, 2 species of squirrel, 3 species of civet, 2 species of gibbon, 1 species of macaque, 2 species of bear, 2 species of deer, and 1 species of elephant) were studied for 3~years in a tropical seasonal forest in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand. The purpose was to examine the dietary overlaps among the large frugivores and the characteristics of fruits they consumed. Most fruit species are eaten by various kinds of frugivores; no close relationship between a particular fruit and a frugivore was found. The number of frugivore groups that served a given plant species was negatively correlated with seed size. Additionally, the fruit/seed diameters consumed by bulbuls were significantly smaller than consumed by the other nine groups. These trends of fruit characteristics were consistent with those observed elsewhere in Southeast Asia: small fruits and large, soft fruits with many small seeds are consumed by a wide spectrum of frugivores while larger fruits with a single large seed are consumed by relatively few potential dispersers. Importantly, these large, single-seed fruits are not consumed by the small frugivores that thrive in small forest fragments and degraded areas in Southeast Asia. To insure the natural seed dispersal process in the forest, an evaluation of all frugivore groups in the forest is urgently needed in Southeast Asia.},

  abstract = {Snares have become a widespread hunting technique, with their indiscriminate nature jeopardizing terrestrial large carnivores. Since the lack of reliable data on snare distribution hampers an accurate evaluation of the potential risk. Continuous winter SMART (the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool) patrols have operated in the Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) and Amur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis) ranges in northeast China from 2013 to 2020 to record wildlife occurrences and remove snares. Our research aimed to assess the snares threat pose in the Amur tiger range and whether snare removal benefited roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) recovery. We modeled the spatial distribution of Amur tigers, Amur leopards, and prey species, comparing their distributions before and after anti-poaching measures. We also assessed the overlap between Amur tigers, Amur leopards, and snare locations. Additionally, we used the MaxEnt model to predict snare distribution, and then we analyzed the overlap of snares with species at different periods between 2013 and 2015 and 2018--2020. Our results showed that the probability of occurrence of ungulates increased significantly around roads after snares were removed. Furthermore, we found that Amur tigers and Amur leopards distribution overlapped with snare locations suggesting that snares pose a serious risk to these non-target species. The overlap between snares and species has the same trend as the growing with species distribution, and the least significant increase is in DHZ-XNC. Removing snares not only aids target game species but also protects sympatric large carnivores.},

  abstract = {Plant species with generalized dispersal mutualisms are considered to be robust to local frugivore extinctions because of redundancy between dispersal agents. However, real redundancy can only occur if frugivores have similar foraging and ranging patterns and if fruit is a limiting resource. We evaluated the quantitative and qualitative contributions of seed dispersers for an endochorus mast-fruiting species, Prunus javanica (Rosaceae) in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, to evaluate the potential redundancy of dispersers. Data were collected from tree watches, seed/fruit traps, and seed transects under and away from fruiting trees, feeding and seed deposition by gibbons (Hylobates lar), and evaluations of seed and first-year seedling survival. We identified three clusters of dispersers within the network. Most ({$>$}80\%) frugivore species observed were small birds and squirrels that were not functional dispersers, dropping most seeds under or very near the tree crown, where seedling survival was ultimately nil. Monkeys (Macaca leonina) were low-quality, short-range dispersers, but they dispersed large numbers of seeds and were responsible for 67\% of surviving first-year seedlings. Gibbons and Oriental Pied Hornbills (Anthracoceros albirostris) handled few fruits, but they provided the highest quality service by carrying most seeds away from the canopy to medium and long distances, respectively. Although there was overlap in the deposition patterns of the functional dispersers, they displayed complementary, rather than redundant, roles in seed dispersal. Satiation of all functional dispersers further limited their capacity to ``replace'' one another. Redundancy must be evaluated at the community level because each type of disperser may shift to different species in the non-masting years of P. javanica. Our results underscore the need for research on broader spatial and temporal scales, which combines studies of dispersal and plant recruitment, to better understand mechanisms that maintain network stability.},

In particular, crime scientists can contribute to the development, implementation, and evaluation of crime and intelligence analysis that address wildlife crime. Crime and intelligence analysis has gained significant attention from conservationists in recent years due to the increasing accessibility and capabilities of various forms of information technology. This has led to significant gains in the ability to collect and analyse information resulting in the push for intelligence-led approaches to guide wildlife law enforcement. Based on a process evaluation of the Uganda Wildlife Authority's intelligence strategy, this paper contributes to the literature by introducing an intelligence-led conservation framework, as well as an operational model referred to as the Ranger Analytic Intelligence Network specifically tailored for conservation efforts in Uganda. Several important caveats that warrant consideration prior to and during the development of an intelligence-led conservation approach are also presented. Lastly, implications for policy are discussed.},

  abstract = {Quantifying ecosystem functions in spatially explicit ways is important for management decisions in increasingly fragmented landscapes. Between-patch dispersal of seeds by frugivores constitutes a key ecosystem function to ensure connectivity for fleshy-fruited plants. However, to date, methodological hurdles have limited our understanding of dispersal pathways on the landscape scale. We made use of newly available tracking devices and combined movement data of 30 trumpeter hornbills Bycanistes bucinator with gut passage times and high-resolution habitat data in a fragmented forest landscape in South Africa. We identified each potential seed dispersal path and distinguished whether potential seed transport happened to a different forest patch (between-patch dispersal), within the same patch (within-patch dispersal) or into the habitat matrix (failed dispersal). To quantify functional landscape connectivity, we identified all possible between-patch connections and used graph networks to estimate landscape connectivity provided by hornbills. Although potential between-patch dispersal events were rare (on average 7\% compared to 20\% failed dispersal and 73\% within-patch dispersal), hornbills could cover distances of up to 15 km. Hornbills visited over 100 forest patches and connected a habitat network with an extent of about 50 km, which increased the potential functional connectivity of the landscape more than twofold. We identified habitat patches that were critical stepping stones for seed dispersal pathways. Without these stepping stones, the network would likely disintegrate into separated components and lead to isolation of forest fragments. Synthesis and applications. We showed that large frugivorous birds can greatly improve functional connectivity for fleshy-fruited plants across broad scales, linking habitat patches in fragmented forest landscapes. Combining high-resolution movement and landscape data in graph networks allows identifying seed dispersal pathways and critical stepping stones in fragmented landscapes. This approach addresses the general challenge of spatially explicit mapping of ecosystem services and can be widely incorporated in reserve design and landscape-level conservation planning.},

  abstract = {Seed dispersal by frugivores is vital to the maintenance of tree diversity in tropical forests. However, determining the influence of different frugivores over the distribution of their food plants is difficult, given the complexity of these interactions in the tropics. Consequently, most studies have been restricted to small scales, examining seed dispersal and establishment associated with nests, roosts or fruiting trees. Here, we evaluate the role of frugivorous hornbills in dispersing seeds at spatial scales of 1 ha. We monitored hornbills and seed rain at a tropical forest site in north-east India. We quantified the abundance of hornbill food plants and recruits of large-seeded plants. We estimated removal rates of dispersed, large seeds to determine post-dispersal seed fate. We found that the distribution of large-seeded canopy food plants influenced the distribution of the relatively abundant Rhyticeros undulatus. The overall distribution of hornbills resulted in spatially contagious seed rain patterns for the large-seeded plant species. Patches with canopy food plants had a higher recruit diversity. Our results show positive feedback between distribution of rare but important hornbill food plants, hornbills and distribution of seeds and saplings of large-seeded plants in the landscape. Widespread loss of hornbills due to hunting and habitat loss in the region have likely disrupted these feedback mechanisms that are critical for tree species regeneration.},

Tropical forests harbour among the highest levels of terrestrial species diversity and are likely to experience rapid land-use change in the coming decades. Synthetic analyses of observed responses of species are useful for quantifying how land use affects biodiversity and for predicting outcomes under land-use scenarios. Previous applications of this approach have typically focused on individual taxonomic groups, analysing the average response of the whole community to changes in land use. Here, we incorporate quantitative remotely sensed data about habitats in, to our knowledge, the first worldwide synthetic analysis of how individual species in four major taxonomic groups---invertebrates, `herptiles' (reptiles and amphibians), mammals and birds---respond to multiple human pressures in tropical and sub-tropical forests. We show significant independent impacts of land use, human vegetation offtake, forest cover and human population density on both occurrence and abundance of species, highlighting the value of analysing multiple explanatory variables simultaneously. Responses differ among the four groups considered, and---within birds and mammals---between habitat specialists and habitat generalists and between narrow-ranged and wide-ranged species.},

The voluntary REDD+\,scheme offers a new framework for the protection of high deforestation landscapes, jurisdictions, and countries backed by international carbon finance. Here we analyzed the economic drivers of deforestation in Cambodia and the effectiveness of 3 REDD+\,projects vs. adjacent protected areas. We find that Economic Land Concessions were a predominant driver of deforestation in Cambodia and influenced the trajectory of illegal forest conversion in PAs. Furthermore, REDD+\,projects offer significantly more protection against deforestation than adjacent PAs in two of the three analyzed cases, likely due to enhanced funding enabling implementation of targeted community activities and rigorous monitoring and enforcement.},

  abstract = {Arboreal frugivores, such as primates and hornbills, are important seed dispersers for many tropical plant species, yet the degree to which they use the same resources is unknown. If primates and hornbills consume the same fruit species, they may be redundant in their roles as seed dispersers, and the loss of one of these taxa may be compensated for by the other. To examine resource use by tropical frugivores, we quantified the feeding habits of two hornbill species, Ceratogymna atrata and C. cylindricus, and five primate species, Colobus guereza, Lophocebus albigena, Cercopithecus pogonias, C. cephus, and C. nictitans, in the lowland rainforest of south-central Cameroon. Based on over 2200 feeding observations recorded between January and December 1998, we characterized the diets and estimated dietary overlap among frugivore species. Previous studies have calculated dietary overlap by counting the number of diet species that two animals share, often leading to inflated estimates of overlap. Our method incorporated the proportional use of diet species and fruit availability into randomization procedures, allowing a clearer assessment of the actual degree of overlap. This added complexity of analysis revealed that, although the diets of a hornbill and a primate species may have as many as 36 plant species in common, actual dietary overlap is low. These results suggested that there are distinct hornbill and primate feeding assemblages, with primates consuming a greater diversity of plant species and higher levels of nonfruit items like leaves and seeds. Using Correspondence Analysis, we also identified two primate assemblages, separated largely by degree of frugivory and folivory. In addition, we found that hornbills feed at significantly higher strata in the forest canopy and eat fruits of different colors than primates. Averaged across the year, overlap between groups (hornbill--primate) was significantly lower than combined within-group overlap (primate--primate and hornbill--hornbill), showing that primates and hornbills have dissimilar diets and are not redundant as seed dispersers. In equatorial Africa, primate populations face greater declines than hornbill populations because of hunting. It is unlikely that seed dispersal by hornbills will compensate for the loss of primates in maintaining forest structure.},

  abstract = {Distance-sampling methods are commonly used in studies of animal populations to estimate population density. A common objective of such studies is to evaluate the relationship between abundance or density and covariates that describe animal habitat or other environmental influences. However, little attention has been focused on methods of modeling abundance covariate effects in conventional distance-sampling models. In this paper we propose a distance-sampling model that accommodates covariate effects on abundance. The model is based on specification of the distance-sampling likelihood at the level of the sample unit in terms of local abundance (for each sampling unit). This model is augmented with a Poisson regression model for local abundance that is parameterized in terms of available covariates. Maximum-likelihood estimation of detection and density parameters is based on the integrated likelihood, wherein local abundance is removed from the likelihood by integration. We provide an example using avian point-transect data of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) collected using a distance-sampling protocol and two measures of habitat structure (understory cover and basal area of overstory trees). The model yields a sensible description (positive effect of understory cover, negative effect on basal area) of the relationship between habitat and Ovenbird density that can be used to evaluate the effects of habitat management on Ovenbird populations.},

  abstract = {Relationships between species abundance and occupancy are of considerable interest in metapopulation biology and in macroecology. Such relationships may be described concisely using probability models that characterize variation in abundance of a species. However, estimation of the parameters of these models in most ecological problems is impaired by imperfect detection. When organisms are detected imperfectly, observed counts are biased estimates of true abundance, and this induces bias in stated occupancy or occurrence probability. In this paper we consider a class of models that enable estimation of abundance/occupancy relationships from counts of organisms that result from surveys in which detection is imperfect. Under such models, parameter estimation and inference are based on conventional likelihood methods. We provide an application of these models to geographically extensive breeding bird survey data in which alternative models of abundance are considered that include factors that influence variation in abundance and detectability. Using these models, we produce estimates of abundance and occupancy maps that honor important sources of spatial variation in avian abundance and provide clearly interpretable characterizations of abundance and occupancy adjusted for imperfect detection.},

Animals disperse the seeds of 60\%--90\% of trees in tropical rainforests, which are among the most structurally complex ecosystems on Earth. Here, we investigated how 3D rainforest structure influences the movements of large, frugivorous birds and resulting spatial patterns of seed dispersal. We GPS-tracked white-thighed (Bycanistes albotibialis) and black-casqued hornbills (Ceratogymna atrata) in a study area surveyed by light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in southern Cameroon. We found that both species preferred areas of greater canopy height and white-thighed hornbill preferred areas of greater vertical complexity. In addition, 33\% of the hornbills preferred areas close to canopy gaps, while 16.7\% and 27.8\% avoided large and small gaps, respectively. White-thighed hornbills avoided swamp habitats, while black-casqued increased their preference for swamps during the hottest temperatures. We mapped spatial probabilities of seed dispersal by hornbills, showing that 3D structural attributes shape this ecological process by influencing hornbill behaviour. These results provide evidence of a possible feedback loop between rainforest vegetation structure and seed dispersal by animals. Interactions between seed dispersers and vegetation structure described here are essential for understanding ecosystem functions in tropical rainforests and critical for predicting how rainforests respond to anthropogenic impacts.},

In Thailand, Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (HKK) still contains the endangered banteng (Bos javanicus) and the vulnerable gaur (Bos gaurus) and sambar (Rusa unicolor). These species have been declining for decades in SE Asia. HKK is within the core area of the Western Forest Complex, one of the largest protected forest landscapes in SE Asia. This area is one of the few remaining that have the capacity to support species recovery for large ungulates and the tiger that depend on them. However, critical knowledge gaps remain on ungulate population metrics and trends of the species. In 2021, we revisited the locations surveyed in 2007--2008 and used distance sampling methodology to estimate density and abundance of banteng, gaur, and sambar. Using 32 transects in 2007, 2008 and 2021, we conducted replicated sample surveys with a total walk-efforts of 1,000\,km per year and collected Distance-sampling data on target species. Banteng density increased two-fold from 0.91 {\textpm} 0.40--1.71 {\textpm} 0.79 individuals/km2, and sambar density doubled from 2.03 {\textpm} 0.51--3.99 {\textpm} 0.95 individuals/km2.

However, a Bayesian analytical approach using informed priors and borrowing detection information across surveys can increase precision and decrease required sample sizes. Using these methods, we conducted distance sampling surveys across a majority of the Dall's sheep habitat within National Park Service units in Alaska during 2010--2011. We compared 4 analytical scenarios using increasing amounts of detection information to demonstrate the increases in efficiency that can be gained over time through the use of this approach. Based on our analysis using all available survey information in the estimation of the detection function, we estimated that 2,252 (1,871--2,765), 2,809 (2,361--3,379), 1,669 (1,339--2,120), and 12,428 (10,780--14,470) sheep occurred in Denali National Park and Preserve (DENA), the Western Arctic National Parklands (WEAR), the Itkillik preserve subarea of Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, and Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve (WRST), respectively. These estimates were achieved with relatively small numbers of group detections in DENA (n = 57), the Itkillik preserve area (n = 48), and WEAR (n = 100), suggesting that sample size requirements for Dall's sheep distance sampling surveys can be reduced by an additional 50--75\% over previously recommended levels when adequate prior information is available.

  abstract = {Monitoring population parameters of invasive species gains importance as these species continue to expand all over the world. Monitoring of invasive mammalian mesopredators is, however, complicated due to their nocturnal and secretive behaviour. In the European Union, the most common invasive mesopredator is the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), which causes concerns for native species, such as endangered waterfowl that may be subject to nest predation. We studied the density of mesopredators in southern Finland with wildlife cameras, using methodology of distance sampling. We deployed in total of 175 camera traps around 11 (spring 2020) and 16 (spring 2021) lakes or wetlands. We inferred densities for raccoon dogs, and for native mesopredators the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the European badger (Meles meles) for comparison. Raccoon dogs were found to have higher overall as well as site-specific densities (about 3.7 ind./km2) than badgers (1.2 ind./km2) and red foxes (0.6 ind./km2). The raccoon dogs also were present at every study wetland, while badgers were not found at all sites. The red fox showed more diurnal activity compared to raccoon dogs and badgers. Camera trap distance sampling enabled us to provide a density estimates on a rather small spatial and temporal scale for species of similar size and movement speed. It could therefore prove valuable as a long-term monitoring option, as climate trends are likely to further enable raccoon dog expansion.

  abstract = {Internal security problems from the 1960s up until 1998 prevented any fieldwork in Cambodia. Since then, the situation has improved greatly and the Royal Government of Cambodia, in collaboration with international conservation NGOs, has been conducting general biological surveys across the country. Survey reports were used to investigate current occurrence of hornbills. Historically, three hornbill species --- Great Hornbill Buceros bicornis, Wreathed Hornbill Aceros undulatus and Oriental Pied Hornbill Anthracoceros albirostris --- were known from Cambodia. Recent surveys show that populations of Great and Wreathed Hornbills have declined significantly since the 1960s, while Oriental Pied is still common. A fourth hornbill species, Brown Hornbill Anorrhinus tickelli, was reported in 1998 in Kirirom National Park spanning the border of Koh Kong and Kompong Speu provinces in south-west Cambodia. Conservation priorities and priorities for future surveys are being developed.},

  abstract = {Aim We map estimated historical population declines resulting from species-specific models of sensitivity to habitat fragmentation for three forest-dependent chameleons. Location East Usambara Mountains, Eastern Arc Mountains, Tanzania. Methods We surveyed three chameleon species (Rhampholeon spinosus, Rhampholeon temporalis and Trioceros deremensis) along 32.2 km of transects and used a hierarchical, distance-sampling model to estimate densities. The model included habitat characteristics at the landscape (patch) and local (transect) scales while accounting for detectability. By analysing the model in a Bayesian framework, we were able to propagate error through the entire analysis and obtain exact solutions despite small sample sizes. We then used our estimated relationships between habitat and density to project chameleon population sizes across current and historical land cover maps of the study area (230 km2), giving an estimate of the impact of anthropogenic habitat alteration on these species. Results Species' densities increased in larger patches and further from patch edges and varied seasonally. Local vegetation characteristics had significant relationships with expected chameleon densities, though effect sizes were small. Estimates of total current population sizes varied by two orders of magnitude among species, but each was 49--79\% higher than detection-na{\"i}ve estimates. All three declined from estimated historical levels by approximately 60\% in the study area, approximately one-third more than would be expected from forest loss alone. Remaining populations of the study species are predominantly located in protected nature reserves, so the future of these species will likely be determined by the degree of protection offered by the nature reserves. Main conclusions Habitat loss and fragmentation have greatly reduced forest-dependent chameleon population sizes in the East Usambara Mountains. Populations of these species in other areas are experiencing higher rates of habitat loss. Efforts aimed at ensuring the efficacy of protected forests may be a key to conserving remaining populations.},

  abstract = {Population size and habitat-specific abundance estimates are essential for conservation management. A major impediment to obtaining such estimates is that few statistical models are able to simultaneously account for both spatial variation in abundance and heterogeneity in detection probability, and still be amenable to large-scale applications. The hierarchical distance-sampling model of J. A. Royle, D. K. Dawson, and S. Bates provides a practical solution. Here, we extend this model to estimate habitat-specific abundance and rangewide population size of a bird species of management concern, the Island Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma insularis), which occurs solely on Santa Cruz Island, California, USA. We surveyed 307 randomly selected, 300 m diameter, point locations throughout the 250-km2 island during October 2008 and April 2009. Population size was estimated to be 2267 (95\% CI 1613--3007) and 1705 (1212--2369) during the fall and spring respectively, considerably lower than a previously published but statistically problematic estimate of 12 500. This large discrepancy emphasizes the importance of proper survey design and analysis for obtaining reliable information for management decisions. Jays were most abundant in low-elevation chaparral habitat; the detection function depended primarily on the percent cover of chaparral and forest within count circles. Vegetation change on the island has been dramatic in recent decades, due to release from herbivory following the eradication of feral sheep (Ovis aries) from the majority of the island in the mid-1980s. We applied best-fit fall and spring models of habitat-specific jay abundance to a vegetation map from 1985, and estimated the population size of A. insularis was 1400--1500 at that time. The 20--30\% increase in the jay population suggests that the species has benefited from the recovery of native vegetation since sheep removal. Nevertheless, this jay's tiny range and small population size make it vulnerable to natural disasters and to habitat alteration related to climate change. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical distance-sampling models hold promise for estimating population size and spatial density variation at large scales. Our statistical methods have been incorporated into the R package unmarked to facilitate their use by animal ecologists, and we provide annotated code in the Supplement.},

Distance sampling allows estimating population size while accounting for imperfect detection, but existing methods do not allow for estimation of demographic parameters. We develop a model that uses temporal correlation in abundance arising from underlying population dynamics to estimate demographic parameters from repeated distance sampling surveys. Using a simulation study motivated by designing a monitoring program for Island Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma insularis), we investigated the power of this model to detect population trends. We generated temporally autocorrelated abundance and distance sampling data over six surveys, using population rates of change of 0.95 and 0.90. We fit the data generating Markovian model and a mis-specified model with a log-linear time effect on abundance, and derived post hoc trend estimates from a model estimating abundance for each survey separately. We performed these analyses for varying numbers of survey points. Power to detect population changes was consistently greater under the Markov model than under the alternatives, particularly for reduced numbers of survey points. The model can readily be extended to more complex demographic processes than considered in our simulations. This novel framework can be widely adopted for wildlife population monitoring.},

  abstract = {Distance sampling is a common survey method in wildlife studies, because it allows accounting for imperfect detection. The framework has been extended to hierarchical distance sampling (HDS), which accommodates the modelling of abundance as a function of covariates, but rare and elusive species may not yield enough observations to fit such a model. We integrate HDS into a community modelling framework that accommodates multi-species spatially replicated distance sampling data. The model allows species-specific parameters, but these come from a common underlying distribution. This form of information sharing enables estimation of parameters for species with sparse data sets that would otherwise be discarded from analysis. We evaluate the performance of the model under varying community sizes with different species-specific abundances through a simulation study. We further fit the model to a seabird data set obtained from shipboard distance sampling surveys off the East Coast of the USA. Comparing communities comprised of 5, 15 or 30 species, bias of all community-level parameters and some species-level parameters decreased with increasing community size, while precision increased. Most species-level parameters were less biased for more abundant species. For larger communities, the community model increased precision in abundance estimates of rarely observed species when compared to single-species models. For the seabird application, we found a strong negative association of community and species abundance with distance to shore. Water temperature and prey density had weak effects on seabird abundance. Patterns in overall abundance were consistent with known seabird ecology. The community distance sampling model can be expanded to account for imperfect availability, imperfect species identification or other missing individual covariates. The model allowed us to make inference about ecology of species communities, including rarely observed species, which is particularly important in conservation and management. The approach holds great potential to improve inference on species communities that can be surveyed with distance sampling.},

  abstract = {Hornbills are particularly important seed dispersers in tropical Asian forests, but most of the species in the region are declining. In addition, long-term data on the extent of the declines and how forest degradation impacts hornbills remain mostly unquantified. Here, we used multi-covariate distance sampling to estimate the densities of hornbills in 2021--2022 in Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary and Budo Su-Ngai Padi National Park protected areas in southern Thailand. These two sites are particularly useful for comparison due to differences in protection levels, with Bala being relatively less disturbed than Budo Mountain and because Bala was surveyed 20 years prior (2001--2002). Fig tree watches were also conducted in 2021--2022 to assess the potential impact of forest disturbance on hornbill visitation rates. Results indicated significant differences in hornbill densities between the two sites. The mean density of the Rhinoceros (Buceros rhinoceros) and Wreathed Hornbill (Rhyticeros undulatus) was 3.2 and 5.1 times higher in Bala than in Budo, while the mean density of the Great Hornbill (Buceros bicornis) was 2.2 times higher in Budo than in Bala. The density of the Helmeted Hornbill (Rhinoplax vigil) was notably lower than other hornbill species. There were also significant changes over the past 20 years in large hornbill densities, with Great Hornbill and Wreathed Hornbill significantly increasing, while the Helmeted Hornbill declined more than 90\,\%. Also, the probability of hornbills visiting fruiting Ficus trees was higher in the less-disturbed Bala than the Budo Mountain, making hornbills more reliable visitors in the less-disturbed site. We demonstrate the applicability of the multi-covariate distance sampling approach to estimate densities of rare hornbills, the negative impacts of habitat degradation on hornbills and the ecological role they play as seed dispersers. Additional surveys are needed throughout tropical Asia to establish further sites for long-term monitoring, especially in the Sunda region, where the Helmeted Hornbill is under extreme threat.},

Thirteen line transects covering 6.2 km were established in open, pine-oak habitat favoured by the nuthatch, during November 2014 to December 2015. The mean density of Giant Nuthatch was 3.94{\textpm}1.22 (95\% CI = 2.15--7.22) individuals/km2. Hierarchical distance sampling models indicated that habitat use by Giant Nuthatch was strongly correlated with trees of large diameter. A pair of Giant Nuthatches was radio-tracked as they fed nestlings during the 2016 breeding season. The female's home range, centred on the nest, was 7.79 ha (95\% kernel home range), approximately one-fourth of that of the male, 32.01 ha. Giant Nuthatches showed a significant preference for foraging on pines Pinus spp. and used the fissured bark of mature pines in which to store acorns of deciduous tree species. Our research indicates the importance of large, mature trees in open pine-oak forest in supporting Giant Nuthatch populations.},

  abstract = {Vegetation structure mapping is critical for understanding the global carbon cycle and monitoring nature-based approaches to climate adaptation and mitigation. Repeated measurements of these data allow for the observation of deforestation or degradation of existing forests, natural forest regeneration, and the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices like agroforestry. Assessments of tree canopy height and crown projected area at a high spatial resolution are also important for monitoring carbon fluxes and assessing tree-based land uses, since forest structures can be highly spatially heterogeneous, especially in agroforestry systems. Very high resolution satellite imagery (less than one meter (1~m) Ground Sample Distance) makes it possible to extract information at the tree level while allowing monitoring at a very large scale. This paper presents the first high-resolution canopy height map concurrently produced for multiple sub-national jurisdictions. Specifically, we produce very high resolution canopy height maps for the states of California and S{\~a}o Paulo, a significant improvement in resolution over the ten meter (10~m) resolution of previous Sentinel / GEDI based worldwide maps of canopy height. The maps are generated by the extraction of features from a self-supervised model trained on Maxar imagery from 2017 to 2020, and the training of a dense prediction decoder against aerial lidar maps. We also introduce a post-processing step using a convolutional network trained on GEDI observations. We evaluate the proposed maps with set-aside validation lidar data as well as by comparing with other remotely sensed maps and field-collected data, and find our model produces an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.8~m and Mean Error (ME) of 0.6~m.},

  abstract = {The spatial monitoring and reporting tool (SMART) is being implemented in Tanzania's protected areas to help improve the efficiency of ranger patrols. Unfortunately, there has been no attempt to understand users' perspectives regarding site-specific factors likely to affect its use. In this study, we investigated the perspectives of staff in Ugalla Game Reserve, a protected area in western Tanzania, to understand the challenges that affect the use of SMART in the reserve. The main challenges included a lack of motivation to use SMART, limited knowledge of SMART among game scouts, insufficient ranger capacity, difficulty collecting data during night patrols, limited resources for patrolling, and difficulty accessing some remote sections of Ugalla. The presence of trophy hunting company patrol teams has led Ugalla rangers to concentrate their effort in less-patrolled areas. We recommend introducing incentives to encourage game rangers to use SMART alongside improving patrol coverage in wet seasons. Advanced and regular refresher trainings in SMART should be conducted to enhance data collection. Furthermore, game scouts should be trained and equipped to participate effectively in the SMART process. Although SMART is now becoming increasingly popular in Tanzania, understanding local factors that influence its implementation will be important to improve uptake.},

  abstract = {Understanding the historical biogeography of this global biodiversity hotspot is as important to long-term conservation goals as ecology and evolution are to understanding current patterns and processes. Today's geography is, however, misleading and typical of only {\textasciitilde}2\% of the last million years; {$>$}90\% of that time the region's land area was 1.5--2.0 times larger as mean sea levels were 62~m below today's, climates were cooler, and extensive forests and savanna covered the emerged Sunda plains. The region's land area varied two-fold as sea levels fluctuated up to {\textpm}50~m with each of {\textasciitilde}50 Pleistocene glacial cycles, and forests expanded and contracted with oscillations in land area and seasonality. This dynamic geographic history is relevant to the development of biogeographic regionalism and shows that it is today's forests that are refugial, not those of the Last Glacial Maximum. This history affects how species will adapt or shift their ranges in response to global warming and further decreases in land area (submergence of low-lying coastal areas) during the 21st century. The alternative is mass species extinction. The biota is also threatened by the continued destruction of forest, destruction of Mekong River flood-pulse based ecosystems, and continued human population growth. Human biogeography will become more important in conservation planning as tens of millions of people who depend on protected area forests, riverine ecosystems, and coastal habitats become environmental refugees. Conservation scientists need to become more involved in regional ecological education, environmental stewardship, and ecosystem-based adaptation to sustain as much as possible of this rich biota and the ecological services it provides.},

Maps and project descriptions reveal that climate-related policies and extraction coexist in the same landscape, even the same projects. Knowledge co-produced by the authors and affected individuals suggests that climate change mitigation initiatives are not only intimately linked to economic intensification in Prey Lang, but they also contribute to conflict and dispossession. We argue that by attending to the cumulative effects of multiple projects in the same landscape and co-producing knowledge with affected communities, researchers can contribute to more socially just environmental policies.},

This review explores the effectiveness of incorporating free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC), safeguard principles, grievance redress mechanisms, and benefit-sharing mechanisms into CFM and REDD+ in Cambodia, with a focus on enhancing communities' livelihoods and climate change adaptation. This paper synthesizes findings from recent literature on CFM and REDD+ in Cambodia and internationally, analyzing key case studies, policy frameworks, and community engagement strategies. Findings suggest that while REDD+ projects offer potential economic and ecological benefits, challenges related to land tenure, equity in benefit-sharing, and community participation remain. This review highlights the need for stronger community engagement, a robust conflict management structure, clear land tenure policies, equitable benefit-sharing mechanisms, and more climate change adaptation activities to ensure the success of CFM and REDD+ projects in Cambodia and the Global South.},

  abstract = {The global population of saiga Saiga tatarica, categorized as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List, declined by {$>$} 95\% at the end of the 20th century, resulting in several conservation initiatives to protect the species. Previously used methods to monitor population trends were inadequate to assess numbers of saiga properly. We report findings from the first survey for Mongolian saiga S. tatarica mongolica to utilize statistically rigorous methodology, using line transect distance sampling in 2006 and 2007 to obtain population estimates in and around the Sharga Nature Reserve, the southern part of the species' current range. We estimate a density of 0.54 and 0.78 saiga km-2 in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Our best models suggest that 4,938 (95\% confidence interval, CI = 2,762--8,828) saiga occupied the 4,524-km2 study area in 2006 and 7,221 (95\% CI = 4,380--11,903) occupied the 4,678-km2 study area in 2007. Although these estimates, with their large confidence intervals, preclude an assessment of the impacts of conservation initiatives on population trends, they suggest that the Mongolian saiga population is larger than previous reports based on minimum counts, and adequate to support in situ population recovery. Modifications to the survey protocol hold promise for improving the precision of future estimates. Distance sampling may be a useful, scientifically defensible method for monitoring saiga population trends and assessing the effectiveness of conservation efforts to stabilize and recover populations.},
